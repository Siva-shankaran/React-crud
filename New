The Issue:
When you type in the "Project Description" text box (which can hold a lot of text), if you type more than 12,000 characters, the screen gets "wiped out" or reset. This means the Project Summary disappears, and the page or content might refresh or reset unintentionally.

Example:

NFID 2501CYOR in Production has this issue where, after creating the NFID, the Project Summary disappears when the description is too long.
What Needs to be Done:
Prevent the screen from resetting when the "Project Description" becomes too long.

Currently, it seems that typing too much text in the description is causing an issue, like a full page refresh or state reset.
Display a warning when the description exceeds a certain length (12,000 characters).

You should warn users if they go beyond 12,000 characters, but don't let it reset or wipe the screen.
Ensure the rest of the page stays intact when the description changes.

The NFID creation process and the Project Summary data should remain unaffected, even if the "Project Description" is too long.
What You Should Do First:
Track the Length of Project Description:

Keep track of how many characters the user types. If it exceeds 12,000, show a warning, but don't let it reset the page or the project summary.
Fix the Page Refresh Issue:

When the "Project Description" is updated, make sure only that part of the UI (or state) is changed. The other components (like Project Summary, NFID, etc.) should stay the same and shouldn't be wiped out.
Handle User Input Carefully:

Limit the characters that can be typed into the Project Description, or display a warning if the user exceeds the 12,000-character limit.
Steps to Implement:
Track Description Length and Show a Warning:

Update the description as the user types, but show a message like "You have exceeded the character limit of 12,000" if it goes over the limit.
Ensure Only Description State Changes:

When the "Project Description" is updated, only update that part of the UI (the description itself), and don't refresh or reset other parts of the page.
Why this happens:
State management issues: When you update the description, other parts of the page may be mistakenly reset (like NFID or Project Summary).
Excessive characters are causing an unintended refresh or reset of the screen, which leads to losing the Project Summary data.
In Simple Terms:
You need to:

Limit or warn users if they type too many characters in the "Project Description" (more than 12,000).
Ensure the rest of the page (like the Project Summary and NFID data) stays intact when the description is updated.
Fix the page reset issue by carefully managing which parts of the page need to be updated when the description changes.
If this makes sense, you can start by adding the character limit check and warning for the Project Description, and then we'll focus on making sure the page doesn't reset unexpectedly when it exceeds the limit. Let me know if you'd like more details!
